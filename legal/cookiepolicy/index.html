                        <br />
                        Cookies are small text files which a website may install on your computer or mobile
                        device when you first visit a site or page. A Cookie will help the website, or another
                        website, to recognize your device the next time you visit. Web beacons or other
                        similar files can also do the same thing. We use the term "Cookies" in this policy
                        to refer to all files that collect information in this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many functions Cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember
                        your preferences, analyze how well our website is performing, or even allow us to
                        recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain Cookies contain Personal Information – for example, if you click to "remember
                        me" when logging in, a cookie will store your username.
